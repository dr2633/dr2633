### Derek Rosenzweig  
Founder, Runtime Labs · San Francisco  

I'm building programmable memory and runtime systems for long-horizon agent planning. My focus is on developing UI and infrastructure that align agent behavior with real-world time, feedback, and memory — to build grounded, adaptive, and traceable intelligence.

### Focus

- Long-horizon planning UIs and runtime queues  
- Structured memory traces and feedback integration  
- Time-based abstractions for scheduling and inference (Tempo Tokens)  
- API + infrastructure for agent execution and profiling  

### Runtime Labs

At Runtime Labs, we're building the **temporal runtime layer for agents** — transforming static calendars into programmable execution environments. Our system enables agents to plan, reflect, and coordinate over time.

Key components include:

- Chronologue– Temporal runtime compiler and calendar UI  
- MemPort – Long-term memory interface for structured journaling  
- Agent Runtime – Execution layer for planning, feedback, and profiling  
- Tempo Tokens – Time-grounded tokens for agent reasoning
